        <p> Hi there!  I'm a Staff Attorney serving in Family Court, where I have the privilete of supporting a phenonemal judge in matters that truly inpact families and communities.  I'm deeply commited to justice and find meaning in the day-to-day work of navigating the legal system with compassion and precision.</p>

<p>Originally from Kentucky, I still carry that down-home charm, but my heart beats a little faster whenever I’m in New York City. I never miss a chance to see a Broadway show or catch a ballet at the Met—the arts are a huge source of inspiration and joy for me.</p>

<p>In my downtime, you’ll often find me rolling out a yoga mat, experimenting in the kitchen, or spending quality time with my two precious dogs. I love testing out new recipes on my close friends—there’s nothing like good food and good company.</p>

<p>Musically, I’ve got a soft spot for the classics—Johnny Cash and Dolly Parton are my go-to soundtrack for just about everything.</p>
